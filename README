           libmpd-haskell : A MPD client library for Haskell
         -----------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The Glasgow Haskell Compiler >= 6.4       http://haskell.org/ghc
    Cabal > 1.0                               http://haskell.org/cabal
    network                                   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/network

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=${HOME}
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install --user

    This assumes you have Cabal installed. Cabal is installed by
    default with newer GHCs.

Use:
    Import the MPD module and specify the mpd package (-package mpd)
    when compiling, or add it to the `Build-Depends' list in your
    `_.cabal' file.

Initialisation:
    Provide a running MPD's hostname and port to MPD.connect.

Limitations:
    Most of the API is complete, but some parts, most notably parsing, is
    not yet as good as it could be.

Platforms:
    libmpd-haskell has been confirmed to work on:
        Linux/x86
