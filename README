           libmpd-haskell : A MPD client library for Haskell
         -----------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The Glasgow Haskell Compiler >= 6.4       http://haskell.org/ghc
    Cabal > 1.0                               http://haskell.org/cabal
    network                                   http://haskell.org/ghc

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/ben
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install

    This assumes you have Cabal installed. Cabal is installed by
    default with newer GHCs.

Use:
    Import the MPD module and specify the mpd package (-package mpd)
    when compiling, or add it to the `Build-Depends' list in your
    `_.cabal' file.

Initialisation:
    Provide a running MPD's hostname and port to MPD.connect.

Limitations:
    Very little actual functionality is working yet, but the interface
    is mostly there to see and link to.

Platforms:
    libmpd-haskell has been confirmed to work on:
        Linux/x86
