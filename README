              libmpd : An MPD client library for Haskell
             --------------------------------------------

About MPD:
    MPD is a daemon for playing music that is controlled over network
    sockets. Its website is at http://www.musicpd.org/.

Building:
    $ cd libmpd-haskell
    $ cabal configure --user
    $ cabal build
    $ cabal install --user

    This assumes you have cabal-install, which is available at
    http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install

API compatibility:
    This library covers all the functionality provided by MPD version 0.13.0.

Use:
    Import the Network.MPD module and specify the libmpd package
    (-package libmpd) when compiling, or add it to the `Build-Depends'
    list in your `_.cabal' file.

Limitations:
    Some parts, most notably parsing, are not yet as good as they could be.
    The library is thus ill-suited for applications where speed is a major
    concern.

Platforms:
    libmpd has been confirmed to work on:
        Linux/x86
    Seems to work (as in compile) on Windows XP as well.
