           libmpd-haskell : A MPD client library for Haskell
         -----------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The Glasgow Haskell Compiler >= 6.4       http://haskell.org/ghc
    Cabal > 1.0                               http://haskell.org/cabal

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/ben
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install

    This assumes you have Cabal installed. Cabal is installed by
    default with newer GHCs.

Use:

    Import the MPD module, and use the mpd package (-package mpd) or
    add it to the `Build-Depends' list in your `.cabal' file.

Initialisation:

    Provide a running MPD's hostname and port to MPD.connect.

Limitations:

    It's not thread-safe at the moment, though it wouldn't be too hard
    to improve that. Very little actual functionality is working yet,
    but the interface is mostly there to see and link to.

Platforms:
    libmpd-haskell has been confirmed to work on:
        Linux/x86
