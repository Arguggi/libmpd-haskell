TODO:
    - improve parsing performance
    - Detect password protected hosts.
    - Implement remaining functions mentioned in
    http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/MusicPlayerDaemonCommands
    add, delete, clear, move and playlistinfo should take an optional
    playlist argument so that functions which differ only in that they
    operate on specific playlists may be merged.
    - figure out what exactly playlistfind and playlistsearch are supposed
    to do.
    - create lsdirs, lsfiles and lsplaylists
    - Finish crop.
