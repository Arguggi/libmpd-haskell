\textsc{libmpd} is a client implementation of the MPD music playing
daemon's network protocol. The interface has mostly stabilised and is
usable.  Although the next release will have an improved API using a
typeclass, it should be source compatible.  In version 0.3.1 some bugs
have been addressed to fix the automatic reconnection feature and to
be more permissive with data from the server.

Support for bytestrings is planned for the future.
